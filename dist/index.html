  <h2 id="why">Why chocolate chip cookies are the <strong><em>Best</em></strong>.</h2>
  <p>When many people think of "cookies" or "baked goods," they immediately think of chocolate chip cookies. Brownies, ginger-snaps, and sugar cookies are great, that's a fact, but chocolate chip has cemented itself as a staple in our bake sales, potlucks, and bakeries. Even chocolate-chip cookie dough is a treat in its own right, landing itself right in our ice-cream.<br>

    Acording to Kathleen King, founder of <a href="https://www.tatesbakeshop.com/">Tate's Bake Shop</a> in Southampton, New York, and creator of the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2011/11/tates-bake-shop-named-top-rated-chocolate-chip-cookie/"> top-rated chocolate chip cookie according to Consumer Reports.</a> told CNN that there is a tremendous emotional attachment" to baking chocolate chip cookies. It's true, there is something about biting into a chocolate cookie that transports you back to simpler times.<br>
    
    Aside from the emotional comfort that chocolate chip cookies may provide, there may be scientific explanations for why we salivate for them. Some research suggests that ingredients in chocolate chip cookies may have additive properties. Take sugar: Evidence in humans shows that sugar and sweetness can induce rewards and cravings comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs, including cocaine.

  <h2 id="how"> How did the chocolate chip cookies came to be. </h2>
  <p>The chocolate chip cookie was invented by American chefs Ruth Graves Wakefield and Sue Brides in 1938. They invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. In this era, the Toll House Inn was a popular restaurant that featured home cooking. A myth holds that she accidentally developed the cookie, and that she expected the chocolate chunks would melt, making chocolate cookies. That is not the case; Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, "We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie."She added chopped up bits from a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. The original recipe in Toll House Tried and True Recipes is called "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies". Wakefield gave Nestle the recipe for her cookies and was paid with a lifetime supply of chocolate from the company.</p>

  <h3 id="prep">Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
    <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
     <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
     <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
     <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
     <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
     <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
     <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
     <li>Enjoy!</li>
